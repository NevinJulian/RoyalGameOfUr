        <h1>Irving Finkel v. Tom Scott 2017 Rules</h1>
        <p>Same as the 1990 British Museum rules (RC Bell path, 4 pyramid dice etc.) with the following changes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>7 pieces each instead of 5</li>
            <li>The middle rosette square is a safe square and cannot be taken by an opposing piece</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>British Museum / Irving Finkel</h2>
        <p>This version of the game was published with a replica of the royal gaming board by the British Museum during
            the
            late 1990s. It uses the RC Bell path around the board. It also inaccurately used only five pieces instead of
            seven and four binary pyramid lots instead of 3 viz.:</p>

        <p>0 - move 0 squares - i.e. miss a go.</p>
        <p>1 - move 1 square</p>
        <p>2 - move 2 squares</p>
        <p>3 - move 3 squares</p>
        <p>4 - move 4 squares</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If a counter lands on a rosette, throw the dice again (and again if another rosette is landed upon). The
                same piece need not be moved on the additional throw.</li>
            <li>Pieces may be started onto the board at any time as long as the square to be moved to by the dice throw
                is
                vacant.</li>
            <li>A player must always move a counter if it is possible to do so but if it is not possible, the turn is
                lost.
            </li>
        </ul>
