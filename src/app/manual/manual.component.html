        <h1>Royal Game of Ur rules</h1>
        <p>The Game of Ur is basically a race game. The Game of Ur is played using two sets of seven game pieces. One
            set of pieces is white, and the other set is black. The gameboard is composed of two rectangular sets of
            boxes, one containing three rows of four boxes each and the other containing three rows of two boxes each,
            joined by a "narrow bridge" of two boxes. The gameplay involves elements of both luck and strategy.
            Movements are determined by rolling a set of four-sided, tetrahedron-shaped dice. Two of the four corners of
            each die are marked and the other two are not, giving each die an equal chance of landing with a marked or
            unmarked corner facing up. The number of marked ends facing upwards after a roll of the dice indicates how
            many spaces a player may move during that turn. When a player lands upon one of the fields with a rose, he
            can simply roll the dice again. These fields are the ones in the first corner, the eight field for each
            player and the field just before the end of each player. A single game can last up to half an hour and can
            be very intense. Games are very often unpredictable and close at the end.</p>

        <h1>Object</h1>
        <p>The object of the game is for a player to move all seven of their pieces along the course (picture) and off
            the board before their opponent. The two sides of the board are identical with each other, indicating that
            the two sides of the board belong to each player. When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is
            safe from capture, but, when it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's
            pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must
            restart the course from the beginning. If a piece is located on a field with a rosette, it is safe from
            capture. When a player lands upon one of the fields with a rose, he can roll the dice again. This means
            there are six "safe" squares and eight "combat" squares. There can never be more than one piece on a single
            square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.</p>

        <p>When a player rolls a number using the dice, they may choose to move any of their pieces on the board or add
            a new piece to the board if they still have pieces that have not entered the game. A player is not required
            to capture a piece every time they have the opportunity. Nonetheless, players are required to move a piece
            whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavourable outcome. In order to remove a piece from the board,
            a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one. If the
            player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, they may not remove the piece from the board.

        <p>This version of the game was published with a replica of the royal gaming board by the British Museum during
            the
            late 1990s. It uses the RC Bell path around the board. It also inaccurately used only five pieces instead of
            seven and four binary pyramid lots instead of 3 viz.:</p>

        <p>0 - move 0 squares - i.e. miss a go.</p>
        <p>1 - move 1 square</p>
        <p>2 - move 2 squares</p>
        <p>3 - move 3 squares</p>
        <p>4 - move 4 squares</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If a counter lands on a rosette, throw the dice again (and again if another rosette is landed upon). The
                same piece need not be moved on the additional throw.</li>
            <li>Pieces may be started onto the board at any time as long as the square to be moved to by the dice throw
                is
                vacant.</li>
            <li>A player must always move a counter if it is possible to do so but if it is not possible, the turn is
                lost.
            </li>
        </ul>
